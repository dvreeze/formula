Formula
=======

Formula offers lightweight XBRL formula support.

It is lightweight in many ways:

* It depends on the OIM (Open Information Model), so on aspects instead of XBRL XML syntax
* It does not depend on XPath, and compilation of XPath expressions
* It uses a lightweight (case-class based) taxonomy model
* It can be used for learn about (performance of) XBRL formulas
* It runs in the browser too
* It also offers a lower level of abstraction, in which formula processing is made entirely explicit, on top of aspects
